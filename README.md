This repository contains all the magic needed to containerize a
control plane (a SEA PLANE) on Kubernetes.

All you need to bring with you is:

  1. A Kubernetes cluster
  2. A default storage class
  3. A willingness to try new things

Things you don't need:

  1. Race cars
  2. Lasers
  3. Aeroplanes

Enjoy!
